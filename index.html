    <p class ="p">Here at Ameli's Bakery, we are a family business, and have been for the last 30 years. When we opened in 1988 we were simply selling extra bread we had made, we were just selling it out of our living room. That eventually developed into what it is today! An actual bakery! We still are only family run, with our three children working to keep this bakery running and ethical!</p>
    <p class ="p">We only have the one location due to being family run, but even though it may be harder to get to us, it is surely worth the trouble! Our bread and cakes are the best in town, at an affordable price!</p>
    <p class ="p">We sell common items such as bread and pastries, but also bake to order! If you wish to place a special order, head down to the contact section and look for the special order number.</p>
