    <h2 class="section-title">About Us</h2>
    <p>Here at Ameli's Bakery, we are a family business, and have been for the last 30 years. When we opened in 1988 we were simply selling extra bread we had made. That eventually developed into what it is today! An actual bakery!</p>
    <p>We sell common items such as bread and pastries, but also bake to order! If you wish to place a special order, head down to the contact section and look for the special order number!</p>
